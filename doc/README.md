# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files.

The report can be found [here as python notebook](report.ipynb) and [here as md](report.md). Although the content is the same I would suggest reading the [report.md](report.md) because the organization of the figures is better in the .md file.

The [python notebook](ADS-Project1-vv2340.ipynb) I used for my analysis includes also the text from the report.
