### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Evolution of Philoshopical Ideas
+ This project is conducted by Silvia (Vasiliki) Vlachou

+ Project summary: Philosophy comes from the greek words *“philo”* (love) and *“sophia”* (wisdom). The study of philosophy is of enormous interest, since its evolution reflects the evolution of ideas, beliefs, and the human existence in general. In this project, we are going to discuss the evolution of philosophy over time. Our goal is to eventually answer the following questions:
  * Which are the main ideas and characteristics of each school of thought?
  * Are there similarities between different schools?
  * How have people’s emotions towards specific topics (e.g., god, mind, soul) changed over time?
