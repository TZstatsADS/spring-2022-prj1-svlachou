The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

The `wordcloud` folder includes the wordcloud figures for schools and authors.  
The `topic-modeling` folder contains figures generated during the topic modeling analysis.  
The `sentiment` folder contains figures generated during the topic sentiment analysis.  
The `general` folder includes figures from the initial analysis.
